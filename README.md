# PetLife

PetLife is a browser-based pet care game. Users can make an account using an email and password with authentication powered by the Passport node package.  User password encryption is managed with the bcrypt node package.  Passport will redirect any user that is not logged in back to the landing page if they attempt to access user-dependent content.  After sign-up, users may create a pet with options for selecting their name, color, and species.  Pets have a happiness and fullness score that decrements as time passes.  In order to keep pets happy and fed, users can play games with their individual pets.  If a user no longer wants a pet, they may be permanently deleted.
